The main concept of "IICT WEBSITE" is to devitalized PGD, MIT courses, their students and teachers data maintenance.

    \section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}

        \label{fig:IICT WEBSITE}
    \end{figure}
    \newline
    Figure 1.1 (Entire work-flow) is the overview of the project. Connection of all the entities are dependable to each others.  This gives the simple idea about the functional activities of the project.
    \newline
    Student cycle, In the Figure 1.1 "Student" takes "Courses" ; "Courses" is guided by "Teachers"; "Teachers" creates "Results".
    \newline
    Teacher cycle, In the Figure 1.1 "Director" assign "Teachers"; "Teachers" for particular "Courses"; "Director" publish "Results".
    \newline
    So, every entity is vary much interactive with each other.

        \caption{Data Flow Diagram}
        \label{fig:Data Flow Diagram}
    \end{figure}
    Before using the main function of the software result process, users have to be registered.
    \newline
    All users have - login\_parameter, user\_name, first\_name, last\_name, user\_id, role, post, email, phone\_number, present\_address, parmanent\_address, blood\_group, password\_hash and timeStamp.
    \newline
    Students have some extra informations after complete his/her registration , such as - user\_id(foreign key), registration\_id, year, semester, course\_array and drop\_course\_array. These are the information that contains his/her result of his taken courses and program.
    \newline
    Each programs has some data - program\_name, program\_id, course\_id, nunmber\_of\_semester, total\_credit and course\_length. There will be onew or many course\_id in each programs.
